    "## 1 - Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has 4 primitive (aka basic) data types for variables. Other more complicated data types and data structures will build on these\n",
    "\n",
    "- int (any whole number), ex. `x = 1` or `x = -1` or `x = 0`\n",
    "- float (any decimal number), ex. `x = 1.0`\n",
    "    - Note that ints and floats can use all the common math operations (+, -, *, /) together, ex. 5.8/2 and can be used together with no issue.\n",
    "    - There are other math operations too. Ex. exponents use `**`. Ex. `4**2 = 16`\n",
    "- String (any character-based data), ex. `x = \"Hello World!\"` or x = `'Hello World!'`\n",
    "- Boolean (true/false binary value), ex. `x = True` or `x = 5 > 3`       <-- this is sometimes useful too!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Common Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, you'll find it useful to store multiple pieces of data together, ex. a collection of names. The below are some built in options for doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- list (an ordered array of values with elastic size and as many types as you want), ex. `x = ['a', 1.0, True, 'a']`\n",
    "    - To add to the end of a list, use `.append()`, ex. `x.append(99)`\n",
    "    - To access or edit items in a list, use indexing starting with 0, ex. `y = x[0]` --> `y = 'a'`, OR `x[0] = 'hello'` --> `x = ['hello', 1.0, True, 'a']`\n",
    "\n",
    "- tuple (an ordered group of values with fixed size and as many types as you want), ex. `x = ('a', 1, 1.0, True)`\n",
    "    - Unlike lists, tuples can't be changed after you make them. They are pronounced 'toople' instead of 'tupple' which is dumb and I will always say 'tupple' because I refuse to adapt to bad conventions\n",
    "- set (an unordered group of values with elastic size and as many types as you want. Each element is guaranteed to appear at most once), ex. `x = {'a', 1.0, True}`. Wrap a list with `set()` to make it a set just like that\n",
    "    - To add to a set, use `.add()`, ex. `x.add('z')` --> `x = {'a', 1.0, True, 'z'}`\n",
    "    - If you add a value already in the set, nothing happens\n",
    "    - You can't access items by index which blows\n",
    "- dict (a hashmap. We will explain this more below), ex. `x = { 'Atlanta': 'N2', 'Dallas', 'N3', 'Bothell': 'N4' }`\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, among these data types you will use lists and dicts way more than anything else. Lists are best for most things, especially simple tasks. But any time you need to fetch certain values or have a value associated with something else, dicts are better. We ‚ù§Ô∏è hashmaps in this house\n",
